# Concepts learnt and applied in this project
- **Multidimensional Arrays:**
    - Creating arrays of arrays (grids/matrices).
    - Visualizing data in rows and columns.
    - Iterating through them using nested loops (one loop for rows, inner loop for columns).
- **Memory Addresses:**
    - Understanding that every variable lives at a specific hexadecimal address in RAM.
    - Using the "Address-of" operator (`&`) to reveal where a variable is stored.
- **Pass by Value:**
    - The default way functions handle arguments.
    - Creates a _copy_ of the data; the original variable remains unchanged.
    - Safer but slower for large data.
- **Pass by Reference:**
    - Using the `&` operator in a function declaration (e.g., `void func(int &x)`).
    - Passes the _address_ (or an alias) of the original variable.
    - Allows the function to modify the original variable.
    - More efficient (no copying) but requires care not to accidentally change data.
- **Constant Parameters:**
    - Using the `const` keyword in function parameters (e.g., `void func(const std::string &x)`).
    - Makes the reference "Read-Only."
    - Provides the efficiency of Pass by Reference with the safety of Pass by Value.
